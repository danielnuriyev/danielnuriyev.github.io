# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

## So, what is spiritual, is there a proof?

Since we remember ourselves, we perceive the reality through the 5 external senses.
In addition we have internal phenomena such as feelings and emotions, and thoughts that we also observe.

We can improve the existing senses. For example, we can learn to see farther, see more details and even expand the range of frequencies that we perceive. For now I will not specify how to do this but if you firmly belief that you cannot improve your perception then leave now because to experience what is beyond your current perception you must change yourself.

So you are ready to change your body, your attitude, your thoughts, you will become a tool for perceiving the spiritual.

This approach is opposite to the scientific approach. Therefore scientifically it is impossible to prove that anything spiritual exists.

## Spiritual preconditions

Following are physical preconditions for spiritual development

### Time

- Plan tomorrow.
- Minimize the unavoidable activities. 
- Maximize time spent on achieving one next goal.
- Use workouts as your breaks. Always workout before bed.
- Always sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes before bed.
- Periodically take a day 
  - to walk in a new place;  
  - to see family and friends in person; 
  - to rest through meditation and books with content that expands your mind

### Place

Spend your time in a place that is:
- spatious
- filled with indirect sun light
- aired
- minimalistic in design and objects
- clean
- quiet

### Body

#### Food

- Periodic frequent fasting with drinking water cleans the body.
- Organic and free range food
- Food that contains proteins, minerals and vitamins. Fats and carbs minimized. Unnecessary components such as coffee minimized.
- Amounts that don't make you heavy

#### Exercise

- Upside down positions after you wake up and before drinking after.
- Workout releases stress and serves as a good reset between activities.
- Walk fast outside in a good weather; full body workout on the floor when the weather is bad (judo/jujutsu warm-ups are the best)
- Always stretch after a workout

#### Sleep

- Best time to start preparing for bed starts with astronomical twilight
- Put all electronics away, workout, stretch, shower, read a paper book, sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes

### Attitude

Attitude is about how we react to the external world and to our own state and thoughts.
Below I list attitudes that are the base for unveiling the spiritual.

**Emotional**
- Tranquility. Relax always no matter what. Just breathe out. This is simply a matter of habbit. Relaxation leads to joy.
- Gratitude. Feel gratitude with every breath. If something troubles you, be grateful for the challenge. Gratitude make you always positive and happy.

Tranquility and gratitude lead to stable joy and happiness that are not dependent on the situation.
This is not only useful and pleasant but also a step in the growth of your personaity.

**Behavioral**
- Respect. Be respectful to everyone and everything.
- Procative selftless care. Proactively help even an insect, even if you have to deviate from your current activity. Do it for them.

Respect reduces the pride which is an obstacle for any constructive change. 

Proactive care for the sake of others...well, if I rationalize it, it will not be for the sake of others...

**Mental**

Limitlessness. If you would like to do something and you cannot do it at this moment, give yourself the freedom to think that in the future you'll definitely do it. Limitlessness is not about having, it's about experiencing or doing.

### Mind

#### Limitlessness

When you notice that you know that something is impossible, immediately and always treat it as possible even if it makes no sense.
Nothing bad will happen if you don't limit yourself.

#### Set THE GOAL

Give your life a goal. Do not limit yourself. Do not think about how to achieve the goal.

Without the goal you float on the waves of life. With the goal you catch any wind towards the destination.

Choose the goal thoughfully and periodically review the goal.

Setting the goal helps us see which choices match the goal and which do not. For example, spending time on your phone probably does not match any long term goal.

#### Play roles

Before you start an activity, enter a role in which you can achieve you goal. For example, when you leave for the work, enter the role of the top professional in your current professsion. Make it a habbit for all activities that matter. Entering a role gives you the taste of how it is to be in that role for real, it changes how you behave, how others perceive you and eventually you get what you play.

#### Intention

Schedule regular time to behave as if your goal is achieved. This reprograms the subconsciousness, makes it more receptive to events that bring you closer to your goal.

Intention is when you turn towards your goal and start going in that direction even if the goal or achieving the goal makes no sense. This is fundamentally different from a dream or a desire.

#### How to handle obstacles

When facing an obstacle, look for the shortest path towards your goal without addressing the obstacle directly.
This creates tranquility, creativity and flexibility.

#### Non-Rationalization

Do not rationalize everything that happens.
For example, as you grow spiritually you will face an increasing stream of coincincidencies. 
The scientific part of your mind will naturally present you rationalizations.
These rationalizations squeeze the new into the known, which is, actually counter-scientific. 
Just observe. 
The bigger picture will gradually build itself out.

### Mind++

Previously described mental work makes our mind unlimited and directed.
The following mental work leads to direct experience of something new...

#### Empty Mind

Most thoughts are not helpful for attaining our goal but they occupy our attention and this drains the energy.
Therefore make it a habbit to ignore the thoughts. Thoughts will start to struggle for your attention but if you stay patient they will disappear, you will become still. The longer you stay thoughtless the more you will experience ...

The explanation for this is simple. Focus is one of the core and most important mental tools. Focus requires energy. Switching focus from thought to thought requires constant refocusing. But even withough the focus, thinking the thoughts also requires energy. When the mind is emopty, it becomes clear. All the energy that was previously wasted energizes all the mind without focusing on specific area. Energized mind leads to vivid experience of the environment and ourselves. And most interestingly, dormant mental abilities start to awake...

#### Light

So far I have been trying to stay within materialistic reason. What I am going to say now cannot be rationalized but can be experienced.
When you perceive a meterial object, perceive the Divine Light in it.
Examples:
- breathe in air and feel the 'energy' in the air. I am not trying to persuade you that the air has energy that you can feel. This is purely a mental thing. Just feel the energy. You have nothing to lose.
- When you walk, feel the energy of the ground. Walk on energy.
- When you look at the sky, see the non-physical light filling the space.
Etc.

#### Focus

Focus is one of the core tools of our mind. To do anything we need focus, to do nothing it's enough to lose focus. 
Use focus as one of the most precious 'things' in your possession. Focus on what you do. 
If you cannot focus for long enough, you must rest and then train your focus muscle again. 
Rest is not the same as switching focus to something else. Rest means closing your eyes and not focusing on anything specific.

#### Observation
