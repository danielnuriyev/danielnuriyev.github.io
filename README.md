# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

Most people who write about the spiritual use 'Eastern' sources. Some use Sufism. Some use psychology. Some use various forms of nonesense. 
My main source of information and practice is the Jewish tradition. Some ideas and practices are identical to the rest, some differ. It may be iteresting for you in places where it's different.

## So, what is spiritual, is there a proof?

Since we remember ourselves, we perceive the reality through the 5 external senses.
In addition we have internal phenomena such as feelings and emotions, and thoughts that we also observe.

We can improve the existing senses. For example, we can learn to see farther, see more details and even expand the range of frequencies that we perceive. For now I will not specify how to do this but if you firmly belief that you cannot improve your perception then leave now because to experience what is beyond your current perception you must change yourself.

So you are ready to change your body, your attitude, your thoughts, you will become a tool for perceiving the spiritual.

This approach is opposite to the scientific approach. Therefore scientifically it is impossible to prove that anything spiritual exists.
