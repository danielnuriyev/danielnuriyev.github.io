# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.
