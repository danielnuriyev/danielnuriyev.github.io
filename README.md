# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that is deeper than the feelings and thoughts, something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

## So, what is spiritual, is there a proof?

Since we remember ourselves, we perceive the reality through the 5 external senses.
In addition we have internal phenomena such as feelings and emotions, and thoughts that we also observe.

We can improve the existing senses. For example, we can learn to see farther, see more details and even expand the range of frequencies that we perceive. For now I will not specify how to do this but if you firmly belief that you cannot improve your perception then this text is not for you because to experience what is beyond your current perception you must change yourself.

So you are ready to change your body, your attitude, your thoughts, you will become a tool for perceiving the spiritual.

This approach is opposite to the scientific approach that does not require you to change. Therefore scientifically it is impossible to prove that anything spiritual exists.

On the other hand this also is the scientific approach because it requires direct experience instead of a belief.

### Types of people by their approach to the spiritual

- Scientist. Such a person uses observation and deduction to explain the reality. This is the best approach. It is applicable to the discovery of the spiritual. To explore the spiritual this approach requires all participants to change themselves to experience the same. Therefore practically this approach is not applied to the spiritual. Such people are often complete meterialists, atheists and skeptics of the spiritual.
- Agnostic. Just like a scientist, an agnostic does not deny that the reality is far from being fully explored. But an agnostic extends this attitude towards the spiritual and the devine.
- Believer. Just like a scientist, a believer can be absolutely rational. Like an agnostic, a believer realizes that the reality is way beyond our current knowledge. In addition, a believer treats the spiritual as absolutely real. There may be no base for this belief, or maybe the believer accepts upon oneself a specific idea about the spiritual, either his/her own or an existing. A believer may even practice religious rituals such as speaking to his/her idea of the spiritual, like praying to the Creator of the world. But a believer does not attempt to change oneself in order to experience the spiritual.
- Mystic. A mystic is a person who changes oneself to experience the spiritual. This text is for this person.
- Divine. A divine being living in this world who does not need a proof that he/she exists because he/she simply exists. Such a person preserves the awareness and acts selflessly for the spiritual growth of the world.

This text is for a person who needs a proof that the spiritual exists.

## Spiritual preconditions

Below I am going to describe what you should do to expand your perception. 
The work begins in the physical world because this is what you treat as known.

### Time

- Plan tomorrow.
- Minimize the unavoidable activities. 
- Maximize time spent on achieving one next goal.
- Use workouts as your breaks. Always workout before bed.
- Always sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes before bed.
- Periodically take a day 
  - to walk in a new place;  
  - to see family and friends in person; 
  - to rest through meditation and books with content that expands your mind
  
The goal of time management is to liberate you to pursue your worthy goals.

### Place

Spend your time in a place that is:
- spatious
- filled with indirect sun light
- aired
- minimalistic in design and objects
- clean
- quiet

A proper place declutters your attention.

### Body

#### Food

- Periodic frequent fasting with drinking water cleans the body.
- Organic and free range food
- Food that contains proteins, minerals and vitamins. Fats and carbs minimized. Unnecessary components such as coffee minimized.
- Amounts that don't make you heavy

Proper food cleans your body and liberates energy for pursuing your worthy goals.

#### Exercise

- Upside down positions after you wake up but before you drink.
- Workout releases stress and serves as a good reset between activities.
- Walk fast outside in a good weather; full body workout when the weather is bad (judo/jujutsu warm-ups are the best).
- Always stretch after a workout.

#### Sleep

- Best time to start preparing for bed starts with astronomical twilight.
- Put all electronics away, workout, stretch, shower, read a paper book, sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes.

Efficient sleep resets the ability to focus.

### Attitude

Attitude is about how we react to the external world and to our own state and thoughts.
Below I list attitudes that are the base for unveiling the spiritual.

**Physical**

Tranquility. Relax always no matter what. Just breathe out. This is simply a matter of habbit. Relaxation leads to joy and clarity.

**Breathing**

Gratitude. Feel gratitude with every breath. If something troubles you, be grateful for the challenge. Gratitude makes you always positive and happy.

Tranquility and gratitude lead to stable joy and happiness that are not dependent on the situation.

**Behavioral**

- Respect. Be respectful to everyone and everything.
- Truth
  - Honesty. Always say the truth respectfully not to offend and humbly because this is just your perspective. If you lie once, thinking that the truth will not be discovered, you should also know when discovered, you may never be trusted again. Do not lie even as a joke. There are other ways to joke. Say the full truth. Incomplete truth may lead to different outcome.
  - Bravery. Truth requires respect, humbleness and bravery because truth may lead to temporarily undesirable outcome for you.
  - Reliability. When you agree to do something, you must do it. Otherwise you may never be trusted.
  - Responsibility. When you are responsible for someone and something, do not slack. You will be perceived as unreliable and weak.
- Proactive selfless care. Proactively help even an insect, even if you have to deviate from your current activity. Do it for them.

Respect reduces the pride which is an obstacle for any constructive change. 

Responsibility leads to proactivity which is a precondition for any change.

Bravery leads to freedom which is a feature of spirituality.

Honesty clears the mind to perceive the reality.

Proactive care for the sake of others...well, if I rationalize it, it will not be for the sake of others...

**Emotional**

For most people emotions just happen. They usually follow either the body or the thoughts. After a nice walk, one can feel happy. A pleasant memory can bring a pleasant feeling.

But emotions can and should be caused intentionally. 

- Tranquility. Relaxed body naturally leads to feeling of peace.
- Gratitude. Gratitude requires effort. Receive each breath with gratutude and breathe out with gratitude. This will become a habbit and all the time will be spent with the feeling of gratitude and peace. This breathing can be done with the lower abdomen. I am not going to explain how to breathe with the lower abdomen because this is broadly known from yoga and qigong. In this breathing the body is tied to a feeling. To intensify the feeling we can breathe with the heart. When you breathe, do it as if with your heart. Heart is not necessarily the physical heart but the area in the chest where you feel good emotions such as love.
- Love. When you talk with a person, as you breathe with your heart, hug the person with the heart. After you've become proficient in gratitude, this should be easy and warm. Apply this to everything you interact with.
- Joy. Smile to everything with your heart. When you see or think of a person, an animal, an object, a situation. Plant a smile in anything useful that you do. A physical smile should always start in the heart.
- Openness. After you've learned to act with the heart, open it. Open heart leads to happiness and light.

Creating emotions makes us free from circumstances. Tranquility leads to better perception. Gratitude establishes correct and loving relationship with the spiritual reality. Smiling with the heart makes us truthful at the core. Love towards others is a feature of the spiritual. Open heart is an inner fountain of light and happiness.

Developing the heart not only opens an internal fountain of light, happiness and love but also deploys an additional sense in addition to the 5 physical ones.

**Mental**

Limitlessness. If you would like to do something and you cannot do it at this moment, give yourself the freedom to think that in the future you'll definitely do it. Limitlessness is not about having, it's about experiencing or doing.

Limitlessness is another feature of spirituality.

Attitudes and feelings described above are actually the most natural state of a human that have been dimmed by circumstances.

There are many more good attitudes, behaviors and feelings but the ones listed above are the core for developing perception of the spiritual.

### Mind

The following mental attitudes and behaviors make the mind calm, focused, clear, limitless and thus more perceptive.

#### Limitlessness

When you notice that you know that something is impossible, immediately and always treat it as possible even if it makes no sense.
Nothing bad will happen if you don't limit yourself.

#### Set THE GOAL

Give your life a goal. Do not limit yourself. Do not think about how to achieve the goal.

Without the goal you float on the waves of life. With the goal you catch any wind towards the destination.

Choose the goal thoughfully and periodically review the goal.

Setting the goal helps us see which choices match the goal and which do not. For example, spending time on your phone probably does not match any long term goal.

#### Play roles

Before you start an activity, enter a role in which you can achieve you goal. For example, when you leave for the work, enter the role of the top professional in your current professsion. Make it a habbit for all activities that matter. Entering a role gives you the taste of how it is to be in that role for real, it changes how you behave, how others perceive you and eventually you get what you play.

#### Intention

Schedule regular time to behave as if your goal is achieved. This reprograms the subconsciousness, makes it more receptive to events that bring you closer to your goal.

Intention is when you turn towards your goal and start going in that direction even if the goal or achieving the goal makes no sense. This is fundamentally different from a dream or a desire. 

Intetion is like catching the wind in the sail in the direction of your goal.

When you create an intention, think about the goal and not the steps to achieve it. But when you come across something that brings you closer to the goal, use it with gratitude.

#### How to handle obstacles

When facing an obstacle, look for the shortest path towards your goal without addressing the obstacle directly.
This creates tranquility, creativity and flexibility.

#### Non-Rationalization

Do not rationalize everything that happens.
For example, as you grow spiritually you will face an increasing stream of coincincidencies. 
The scientific part of your mind will naturally present you rationalizations.
These rationalizations squeeze the new into the known, which is, actually counter-scientific. 
Just observe. 
The bigger picture will gradually build itself out.

### Mind++

The following mental work leads to direct experience of something new.

#### Empty Mind

Most thoughts are not helpful for attaining our goal but they occupy our attention and this drains the energy.
Therefore make it a habbit to ignore the thoughts. Thoughts will start to struggle for your attention but if you stay patient they will disappear, you will become still. The longer you stay thoughtless the more you will experience ...

The explanation for this is simple. Focus is one of the core and most important mental tools. Focus requires energy. Switching focus from thought to thought requires constant refocusing. But even withough the focus, thinking the thoughts also requires energy. When the mind is emopty, it becomes clear. All the energy that was previously wasted energizes all the mind without focusing on specific area. Energized mind leads to vivid experience of the environment and ourselves. And most interestingly, dormant mental abilities start to awake...

#### Light

So far I have been trying to stay within materialistic reason. What I am going to say now cannot be rationalized but can be experienced.
When you perceive a material object, perceive the Divine Light in it.
Examples:
- breathe in air and feel the 'energy' in the air. I am not trying to persuade you that the air has energy that you can feel. This is purely a mental thing. Just feel the energy. You have nothing to lose.
- When you walk, feel the energy of the ground. Walk on energy.
- When you look at the sky, see the non-physical light filling the space.
Etc.

And especially when you look into human eyes, see the Divine looking back at you albeit from behind multiple veils.

#### Unity

Constantly keep in mind that all the world is one interconnected system where every choice you make affects everything, even the farthest stars.
Once you start behaving like this, you will see more and more how even your tiniest thoughts affect what's happening around you and how phenomena are interrelated.

### Core components of mind

Following are the core components of the mind that are observed during an observation. Observation is when we observe that we observe. AKA meditation.

It is important to understand them and to start observing them because otherwise the mind will stay veiled.

#### Focus

Focus is one of the core tools of our mind. To do anything we need focus, to do nothing it's enough to lose focus. 
Use focus as one of the most precious 'things' in your possession. Focus on what you do. 
If you cannot focus for long enough, you must rest and then train your focus muscle again. 
Rest is not the same as switching focus to something else. Rest means closing your eyes and not focusing on anything specific.

#### Choice

We constantly observe and choose to focus. For example, a thought appears and we choose whether to focus on this thought or not. This process is so constant that we are not aware of it. Even when you focus on one thing, you are constantly choosing to keep the focus on that thing until you enter a trance in which case you are not choosing, you are kind of asleep. This is how focus and choice rest.

The awareness of choice is a tool to build a path to a next goal.

#### Awareness

Awareness is observing without a thought and without being merged with the observed thing. Although a thought about awareness may appear.
Awareness rests in sleep.

#### Observation

I am not my clothes, my body, my feelings and thoughts because I observe all that. I am the Observer. Being only the observer is the first step into a real meditation. 

This is also the first step where the direct spiritual experience begins. 

When we change the emotional attitude explained above, we start to experience that world around us changes too but we do not see the mechanism through which our attitudes affect the physical world. 

When we are the Observer, we start to experience the spiritual directly. At this point there is nothing to doubt and nothing to prove.

I will not describe what the spiritual is. It is possible through analogy. I'll do this later.

**Deep mental process**

The following happens on the level deeper than thoughts:
- We observe.
- Then we choose to focus or not. If we choose not to focus, there is a new thing to observe.
- If we choose to focus, we focus
- Even if we are completely merged with the object of focus, we are still observing it. But at this point we lose awareness of this fact. But at some point the focus ends and we are aware again. And the cycle continues.

In this cycle, the only constants are the Observer, Focus and the Observed. We may lose the awareness and then the choice.

Observer -> (Awareness -> Choice ->) Focus -> Observed

Observer is who we are actually because all the rest is observed and therefore external to us. Observer is the soul, neshama (נשמה) in Hebrew.

In this schema when the Observer observes, it is presented with the thought that the Observer is observing. Thought has dual purpose:
- by observing this thought, the Observer is aware of itself in the physical world.
- the thought blocks the Observer from the direct experience of the reality and from expressing itself directly in the physical world. More about it below.

**Modes of awareness**

The awareness can be 
- completely in the Observer
- completely in the observed. People call this *being in the flow*.
- shift between the two. In this case you focus on what you do but do not lose control.

An important step in the spiritual discovery is to calm the mind to the state of no thoughts. I would love to describe to you what you will experience when your mind is thoughtless for continuous time but the goal of this text is to bring you to that point and not to affect your experience by preconceived ideas.

### Experience vs expression

Once you experience yourself as the Observer who Chooses to Focus and shift the Awareness into the object of observation, you can understand the difference between a spiritual experience and self expression.

A spiritual experience is what you observe external to your core (Observer). 

Spiritual expression is when the Observer is aware of itself and is free to observe, choose and act. This way the Observer is not dependent on experiences but is free to act and to express its Divine nature using the observable tools.

### Why you are here

You have read so far because you - the Soul - is looking for a way out from the veil of thoughts.

People who are rational, reasonable, logical, scientific, materialist, atheist simply observe this type of thoughts without choosing to dig deeper. Digging deeper is rational as well but based on a direct experience.

### What to do, how to do

Apply each item on this list starting with 'plan tomorrow'. Do not skip any step. Do not proceed to a next step unless at least 2/3 of a current step is mastered, however you'd score it. Two thirds because perfectionism is opposite to freedom. But slacking is also pointless when you have a goal.

The steps listed in this text focus on building you from bottom all the way up to the direct experience of the spiritual. The changes that you will undergo will positively affect all aspects of your life. But this list does not focus on making you financially, socially, physicaslly, emotionally successful. These require another, although intersecting, set of skills. Nonetheless, financial, social, physical and emotional prosperity should acompany your spiritual growth.

It is important not to skip any step because when you reach the state of continuous thoughtlessness, you will be flooded with energy. The body must be prepared to tunnel this energy. When the body is not properly structured, it falls apart. When the feelings are not positive, they become manyfold reinforced. Same goes for attitudes and thoughts.

#### Obstacles

When you start to change yourself, you face multiple obstacles. These obstacles are common to any new regular activity. For example, you have a thought that you have to do something and you get distracted, or you cannot start, or you don't enjoy, or you have doubts, or you do not persist etc. There are easy to deal with because no matter what the obstacle is, you either do or don't do.

But there is one type of obstacle worth special attention. When you switch from poker to pool, you learn a new skill but essentially nothing changes. You are stay the same. But when you start to change yourself, you disbalance a stable system. Every effort you make will be met with equal force that will demonstrate itself in various ways: physical and emotional discomfort, opposite thoughts, people who will strive to keep you from changing in various ways, events that are 'just coincidences'.

### Hardwiring

When we start to perform a new activity repeatedly, neurons that run it connect in ways that make this activity automatic. This means several things for spiritual discovery:
- it takes time, consistency, patience, effort
- difficulty is just the process of rewiring
- obstacles are just the previously hardwired habbits
- it is possible

### Upside down

This text is written for a person with a scientific attitude who would like to discover the spiritual. Imagine that you have discovered the spiritual. And now you are a Spiritual Being (Observer, Soul) living in this physical world. This is the Jewish approach that I am going to describe in a separate text. But briefly, you do not believe but you directly see that thoughts, feelings, body, possessions are just tools that do not have a value of their own. You use them to bring divinity to other beings. This approach is for the benefit of others. This is the true spirituality. When a person strives to grow spiritually, it is for the personal benefit. When a person lives for the benefits of others, growth in experiencing the spiritual is a by-product.
