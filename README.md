# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

Most people who write about the spiritual use 'Eastern' sources. Some use Sufism. Some use psychology. Some use various forms of nonesense. 
My main source of information and practice is the Jewish tradition. Some ideas and practices are identical to the rest, some differ. It may be iteresting for you in places where it's different.

## So, what is spiritual, is there a proof?

Since we remember ourselves, we perceive the reality through the 5 external senses.
In addition we have internal phenomena such as feelings and emotions, and thoughts that we also observe.

We can improve the existing senses. For example, we can learn to see farther, see more details and even expand the range of frequencies that we perceive. For now I will not specify how to do this but if you firmly belief that you cannot improve your perception then leave now because to experience what is beyond your current perception you must change yourself.

So you are ready to change your body, your attitude, your thoughts, you will become a tool for perceiving the spiritual.

This approach is opposite to the scientific approach. Therefore scientifically it is impossible to prove that anything spiritual exists.

## Spiritual preconditions

Following are physical preconditions for spiritual development

### Time

- Plan tomorrow.
- Minimize the unavoidable activities. 
- Maximize time spent on achieving one next goal.
- Use workouts as your breaks. Always workout before bed.
- Always sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes before bed.
- Periodically take a day 
  - to walk in a new place;  
  - to see family and friends in person; 
  - to rest through meditation and books with content that expands your mind

### Place

Spend your time in a place that is:
- spatious
- filled with indirect sun light
- aired
- minimalistic in design and objects
- clean
- quiet

### Body

#### Food

- Periodic frequent fasting with drinking water cleans the body.
- Organic and free range food
- Food that contains proteins, minerals and vitamins. Fats and carbs minimized. Unnecessary components such as coffee minimized.
- Amounts that don't make you heavy

#### Exercise

- Upside down positions after you wake up and before drinking after.
- Workout releases stress and serves as a good reset between activities.
- Walk fast outside in a good weather; full body workout on the floor when the weather is bad (judo/jujutsu warm-ups are the best)
- Always stretch after a workout

#### Sleep

- Best time to start preparing for bed starts with astronomical twilight
- Put all electronics away, workout, stretch, shower, read a paper book, sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes

### Attitude

Attitude is about how we react to the external world and to our own state and thoughts.
Below I list attitudes that are the base for unveiling the spiritual.

**Emotional**
- Tranquility. Relax always no matter what. Just breathe out. This is simply a matter of habbit. Relaxation leads to joy.
- Gratitude. Feel gratitude with every breath. If something troubles you, be grateful for the challenge. Gratitude make you always positive and happy.

Tranquility and gratitude lead to stable joy and happiness that are not dependent on the situation.
This is not only useful and pleasant but also shows maturity and is an important [TO CONTINUE]

**Behavioral**
- Respect. Be respectful to everyone and everything.
- Care. Proactively help even an insect, even if you have to deviate from your current activity.

**Mental**
Limitlessness. If you would like to do something and you cannot do it at this moment, give yourself the freedom to think that in the future you'll definitely do it. Limitlessness is not about having, it's about experiencing or doing.

### Mind

#### Thoughts

Most thoughts are not helpful for attaining to our goal but they occupy our attention and this drains the energy.
Therefore make it a habbit to ignore the thoughts. Thoughts will start to struggle for your attention but if you stay patient they will disappear, you will become still, the world will become bright...

#### Intention

Schedule regular time to behave as if your goal is achieved. This reprograms the subconsciousness, makes it more receptive to events that bring you closer to your goal.

Intention is when you turn towards your goal and start going in that direction even if the goal or achieving the goal makes no sense. This is fundamentally different from a dream or a desire.

#### Role

Before you start an activity, enter a role in which you can achieve you goal. For example, when you leave for the work, enter the role of the top professional in your current professsion. Make it a habbit for all activities that matter. Entering a role gives you the taste of how it is to be in that role for real, it changes how you behave, how others perceive you and eventually you get what you play.

#### Light

So far I have been trying to stay within materialistic reason but this 


#### Limitlessness

Explained above. When you notice that you know that something is impossible, immediately and always treat about it as possible even if it makes no sense.


#### Focus

TO CONTINUE

- Remove all distractions
- Focus on what you are doing now

#### Emptiness



#### Observation

### The above in Torah
