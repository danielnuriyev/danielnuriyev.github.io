# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

Most people who write about the spiritual use 'Eastern' sources. Some use Sufism. Some use psychology. Some use various forms of nonesense. 
My main source of information and practice is the Jewish tradition. Some ideas and practices are identical to the rest, some differ. It may be iteresting for you in places where it's different.

## So, what is spiritual, is there a proof?

Since we remember ourselves, we perceive the reality through the 5 external senses.
In addition we have internal phenomena such as feelings and emotions, and thoughts that we also observe.

We can improve the existing senses. For example, we can learn to see farther, see more details and even expand the range of frequencies that we perceive. For now I will not specify how to do this but if you firmly belief that you cannot improve your perception then leave now because to experience what is beyond your current perception you must change yourself.

So you are ready to change your body, your attitude, your thoughts, you will become a tool for perceiving the spiritual.

This approach is opposite to the scientific approach. Therefore scientifically it is impossible to prove that anything spiritual exists.

## Spiritual preconditions

Following are physical preconditions for spiritual development

### Time

- Plan tomorrow.
- Minimize the unavoidable activities. 
- Maximize time spent on achieving one next goal.
- Use workouts as your breaks. Always workout before bed.
- Always sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes before bed.
- Periodically take a day 
  - to walk in a new place;  
  - to see family and friends in person; 
  - to rest through meditation and books with content that expands your mind

### Place

Spend your time in a place that is:
- spatious
- filled with indirect sun light
- aired
- minimalistic in design and objects
- clean
- quiet

### Body

#### Food

- Periodic frequent fasting with drinking water cleans the body.
- Organic food
- Food that contains proteins, minerals and vitamins. Fats and carbs minimized. Unnecessary components such as coffee minimized.
- Amounts that don't make you heavy

#### Exercise

- Upside down positions after you wake up and before drinking after.
- Workout releases stress and serves as a good reset between activities.
- Walk fast outside in a good weather; full body workout on the floor when the weather is bad (judo/jujutsu warm-up are the best)
- Always stretch after a workout

#### Sleep

- Best time to start preparing for bed starts with astronomical twilight
- Put all electronics away, workout, stretch, shower, read a paper book, sit in a quiet dark place with closed eyes

### Attitude

Attitude is about how we react to the external world and to our own state and thoughts.
Below I list attitudes that are the base for unveiling the spiritual.

**Emotional**
Tranquility. Relax always no matter what. Just breathe out. This is simply a matter of habbit. Relaxation leads to joy.

**Behavioral**
- Respect. Be respectful to everyone and everything.
- Helpfullness. Proactively help even an insect, even if you have to deviate from your current activity.

**Mental**
Limitlessness. If you would like to do something and you cannot do it at this moment, give yourself the freedom to think that in the future you'll definitely do it. Limitlessness is not about having, it's about experiencing or doing.

**Why**
Tranquility heals the body, fills it with energy and makes it more sensitive. This is a precondition to experiencing the spiritual.
Tranquility makes us free because we do not react to vicissitudes. This is a precondition for experiencing something new. 
Tranquility leads to joy and thus makes our reactions positive.
Respect lowers the ego and thus vacates space for the spiritual.
Helpfullness reduces the ego as well.

### Mind

#### Thoughts

A thought appears. Just ignore it. Make it a habbit.

#### Limitlessness

Explained above. When you notice that you know that something is impossible, immediately and always treat about it as possible.

#### Intention

Treat thoughts not as random ideas that happen but as ideas that will happen if you keep thinking them.

#### Focus

TO CONTINUE

- Remove all distractions
- Focus on what you are doing now

#### Emptiness



#### Observation

### The above in Torah
