# spirituality

When we talk about the spiritual, different people mean different things: emotions, morality, creativity, subconciousness, mysticism.
When I talk about the spiritual, I talk about something that we start to observe after we leave the thoughts behind.
A thought is just another phenomenon that we observe. Once thoughts stop veiling the mind, we start to observe the spiritual or superconsciuos phenomena. This is the subject of this blog. Welcome.

Most people who write about the spiritual use 'Eastern' sources. Some use Sufism. Some use psychology. Some use various forms of nonesense. My main source of information and practice is the Jewish tradition. In some points it is identical to the rest, in some it differs. Therefore this may be interesting for you.
