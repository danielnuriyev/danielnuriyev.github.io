# Jewish Spirituality

This is a work in progress. So far I am just throwing here random ideas.

This text is written for people interested in direct spiritual experience. The main reason for writing this is that increasingly more people are interested in the spiritual. Most practical material is based on 'eastern' practices whereas the Jewish people have been transmitting and developing spirituality for 4000 years since Abraham. 

The Jewish spiritual practice is not easily available because if you're a Jewish 'guru' (rebbe, for example), you are modest, you practice it yourself and you naturally transmit it to people around you or to people who heard about you and came to study with you. If you feel that your experience and knowledge are broadly useful, you publish a book in Hebrew. Why Hebrew? Because languages come and go but Hebrew stays. Therefore to find a Jewish spiritual master requires a true desire and a consistent effort whereas finding a YouTube video about meditation is a just few seconds away. 

An opposite issue is that there is increasingly more material about the Jewish spirituality in English but it's either not intended as a practical guide or it is shallow.

Therefore I have decided to share a few highlights and a few references to books. The main emphasis is on constant focused parctice, not on belief, not on understanding, not on knowledge. The study of Torah, which is included in the list, starts with sitting, reading and trying to understand but these are just tools. 

The text is based on my personal experience as of now. My only hope is to keep improving.

First I have to explain the source of Jewish spirituality, which is a formal part, and then I'll dive into the spirituality.

## Sources

Sources of Jewish knowledge:
- spiritual practice started by Avraham (Abraham) and Sarah and transmitted through their grandson Yaaqov's (Jacob) descendants down to us.
- texts received from the Creator of this world by prophets starting with Moshe (Moses)
- meanings of the texts transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- religious and spiritual practice transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- attitudes transmitted through generations of parents from Avraham and Sarah down to us. AKA culture.

In Hebrew the Jewish religion is called התורה The Torah which literally means direction, instruction, teaching.

### Creator

When I write the 'Creator', the natural question is how do we know that there is the Creator.
I have 2 answers:
- Practice. The Jewish religion is based on practice through which the soul gradually becomes more and more aware of itself and of its own Devine connection. What exactly the soul is I will explain below. For now think of it as of who you actually are at your core behind your clothes, body, feelings and thoughts.
- Soul. Some people look at the world from the point of view of the soul from birth. Most people's awareness shifts into thoughts but the soul is still behind the veil of thoughts and although the awareness is in thoughts, thoughts that hint at the existence of the Divine are like a lighthouse for the soul. Even though such people do not experience the spiritual directly, they sub- or, more precisely, superconsciously know that they are Divine at the core.

If these explanations are not persuasive, you should do certain practices that will lead you to the direct experience and unveiling of your most inner self as I described [here](../main/README.md).

### What is soul
 
Anything that we perceive is external to our essence which is the soul. One of the by-products of a spiritual practice is to allow the soul to express itself, to become aware of itself, to be itself.

### the Creator, the world, the souls

Every religion has an opinion about the existence of the Creator, His essence, the ability to perceive Him, the ability to merge with Him, about His relation to the world. Is it He at all. Did he create the world or the world is eternal. Did He create an eternal world. Etc.

Judaim certainly also has an opinion, even multiple ones. Multiple because they address multiple points of view. It may be the point of view of a Jew who starts the spiritual journey with awareness in the physical. It may be the point of view of a Jewish mystic whose awareness is in the soul. Etc.

The goal of this text is to bring you to answers through your direct experience.

### Transmission

How do we know that the Torah has been transmitted faithfully. Because children grow practicing it and studying it all their lives. There has been no other religion in which all men all life long have been studying their religion.

But the surrounding civilizations do affect the application of the Jewish principles and laws. For example, in the past we read a Torah scroll by the candle light, now we read the same scroll under the electic light.

## Jewish Point of View

The best explanation of who we are, what this world is, its goal, what we should do etc. is given by Moshe Chaim Luzzato in [The Way of God best translated by Aryeh Kaplan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087306769X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_thcv_p1_i7).

Everything that we perceive is a tool for coming closer to the Creator, for sharing the Divine with other souls, for helping other souls to discover the Divine, come closer to it and help others.
