# Jewish Spirituality

This is a work in progress. So far I am just throwing here random ideas.

## Sources

Sources of Jewish knowledge:
- spiritual practice started by Avraham (Abraham) and Sarah and transmitted through their grandson Yaaqov (Jacob) descendants down to us.
- texts received from the Creator of this world by prophets starting with Moshe (Moses)
- meanings of the texts transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- religious and spiritual practice transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- attitudes transmitted through generations of parents from Avraham and Sarah down to us. AKA culture.

When I write the 'Creator', the natural question is how do we know that there is the Creator.
I have 2 answers:
- Practice. The Jewish religion is not based on ideas but on practice. Practice unveils the soul which is a ray of God. A ray does not need a proof that it comes from the sun. It is its nature.
- Soul. Some people look at the world from the point of view of the soul from birth. Most people's awareness shifts into thoughts but the soul is still behind the veil of thoughts and although the awareness is in thoughts, thoughts that hint at the existence of the Divine are like a lighthouse for the soul. Such people, even though they do not experience the spiritual directly, they sub- or more precisely superconsciously know that they are divine at the core.

If these explanations are not persuasive, you should do certain practices that will lead you to the direct experience and unveiling of your most inner self as I described [here](../main/README.md).
