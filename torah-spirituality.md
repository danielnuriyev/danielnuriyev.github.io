# Jewish Spirituality

This is a work in progress. So far I am just throwing here random ideas.

This text is written for people interested in direct spiritual experience. The main reason for writing this is that increasingly more people are interested in the spiritual but most practical material is based on 'eastern' practices whereas the Jewish people have been transmitting and developing spirituality for over 4000 years since Abraham. 

The Jewish spiritual practice is not easily available because Jewish spiritual masters first of all transmit it to people around them. If they feel that their experience and knowledge are broadly useful, they or their students publish books in Hebrew. Why Hebrew? Because languages come and go but Hebrew stays. Therefore to find a Jewish spiritual master requires a true desire and a consistent effort whereas finding a YouTube video about meditation is a just few seconds away. 

An opposite issue is that there is increasingly more material about the Jewish spirituality in English but it's either not intended as practical guidance or it is shallow.

Therefore I have decided to share a few highlights and a few references to books. The main emphasis is on constant focused parctice, not on belief, not on understanding, not on knowledge.

First I have to explain the source of Jewish spirituality, which is a formal part, and then I'll dive into the spirituality.

## Sources

Sources of Jewish knowledge:
- spiritual practice started by Avraham (Abraham) and Sarah and transmitted through their grandson Yaaqov's (Jacob) descendants down to us.
- texts received from the Creator of this world by prophets starting with Moshe (Moses)
- meanings of the texts transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- religious and spiritual practice transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- attitudes transmitted through generations of parents from Avraham and Sarah down to us. AKA culture.

In Hebrew the Jewish religion is called התורה The Torah which literally means the direction, instruction, teaching.

### Creator

When I write the 'Creator', the natural question is how do we know that there is the Creator.

There is a list of standard answers such as prophecies, tradition, logical deduction etc.

But the real answer lies in our innermost core which is Divine. This core is the soul, or נשמה in Hebrew.

Regarding the soul there are several types of people:
- a person whose awareness is on the level of the soul.
- a person whose awareness is in the resonable thinking. Reasonable thinking makes perfect sense as long as it allows the expansion of awareness.
- a person who lives through feelings. Although some feelings such the infinity and unity can lead this person to discover the soul, such a person is affected by everything and cannot live as a soul steadily.
- a person whose awareness is in the social and physical. Such a person may believe in something Divine because under the layers of the physical and social needs there still lies a Divine soul that tries to express itself.

In all types of people the soul is striving to live and express itself because it is its nature.

One fruit picked along a spiritual path is shifting the awareness into the soul.

### Transmission

How do we know that the Torah has been transmitted faithfully. Because children grow practicing it and studying it all their lives. There has been no other religion in which all men are commanded to study and transmit their religion.

## Jewish Point of View

The best explanation of who we are, what this world is, its goal, what we should do etc. is given by Moshe Chaim Luzzato in [The Way of God best translated by Aryeh Kaplan](https://seforimcenter.com/HEBREW-Books/Rabbi-Moshe-Chaim-Luzzatto-Ramchal_/Way-of-God-Derech-Hashem---Rabbi-Moshe-Chaim-Luzzatto__p-73-203-316.aspx) and its condensed version Essay of Fundamentals in the end of the same book.

Everything that we perceive is a tool for living as a soul. The tools are possessions and body.
Living as a soul means:
- using the tools for the benefit of others. Benefit may be physical such as providing a place to live and healthy food. It may be non physical such as feeling gratitude. _Others_ includes not only people.
- being grateful for everything, treating problems as lessons, living with the awareness that God is here.
- minimizing the physical needs.
- unveiling the soul by calming the mind. I will explain this below. And by not limiting ourselves as long as the dreams are creative and benefitial.

## Core difference between the Torah and most other religions and spiritual systems

An important distinction of the Torah from most other religions and spiritual systems is that the goal of the Torah is not the spiritual development but spiritual living. In most other religions and systems the goal is the personal spiritual benefit such as the feeling of infinity of love of merging into God, of nearness to God, of liberation and enlightment. In Judaism we do not seek the personal spiritual benefit. We seek to benefit other souls out of love for them and for God, we seek to serve God out of love for God.

Why? Because at the core we are already Divine, infinite, free, blissful etc. God made us this way. We can only be grateful and loving.

The spiritual benefits that the other religions focus on are by-products of living as a soul.

The goals of these other religions and spiritual systems contain a pitfall because to unite with God, to be with God etc. one must be as God who is not an egoist. [The Way of God, Essay of Fundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087306769X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_thcv_p1_i7) and other books explain that God is perfect and does not need anything, therefore God did not create the world for himself. 

### The purpose of creation

God created us - the Divine beings. God created this world that veils the Divine. God planted us in this world to give us the choice between the worldly and the Divine. Through these choices we gradually deserve our Divinity. A person who inherits the greatest wealth is never the same as a person who achieves the greatest wealth through creative and benefitial work.

But why did God create us? Creation of Divine beings is the act of ultimate good.

But how can a consciousness immersed in the physical needs and desires even know that there is the Divine.
There are multiple ways.
On one extreme, through experience. A completely material life is a sequence of suffering, fear and unsatisfied desires. All this expands a person's vision of the world. Usually through multiple lives.
On the other extreme, through direct revelation.
Judaism is a combination. Avraham (Abraham) realized the existence of God and God revealed Himself to Avraham. Avraham taught Yitskhaq (Isaac) about God, Isaac through spiritual life also became a prophet and so on.

But knowing that there is God is not enough. One should also know which choices are Divine. This can also be deduced through meditation, contemplation, observation etc. This is what Avraham did. He observed all the Torah before it was given by God through Moshe (Moses).

Some of the goals of the Torah are to teach us about the existence of God, about God's relation with the world, about how we should act in Divine ways. For example, gathering a harvest is a worldly affair. Gathering a harvest and leaving some of it to the poor as commanded by God is a Divine act.

### Essense of commandments

One goal of the commandments is for the soul to act in Divine ways. Most commandments have a physical component. For example, thanking God for a meal must be done through speech and not only in the heart and the mind. Because the goal is for the soul to use the physical as the tool, for controlling the physical, for changing the physical into the spiritual, for tunnelling the Divinity into the physical world.

One other **core difference of the Torah from most other religions** is not trying to escape the physical in order to get into the Heaven but to enlighten the physical.

It is important to realize that the commandments are for the soul. The commandments are not for the body and not for the society. The goal of the commandments is not to make us healthy and successful, not to make our society nice to live in. All these are certain by-products of souls functioning Divinely. The prohibition to murder certainly makes life better for everyone. And kosher food certainly has health benefits, although there are better diets. But I have never seen a scientific explanation for earing a tefillin, only allegorical ones.

So why should one observe a commandment without knowing its meaning. For the same reason why kids who listen to their parents do not stick a piece of metal into an electric socket. Parents know more about electricity. The Creator knows more about His world. A child can gradually learn. A Jew can gradually grow spiritually and directly experience the meanings of commandments.

### What is direct spiritual experience

I define the spiritual as something that is beyond everything that we perceive. 

We perceive the world that is outside of our body through the senses. We also perceive some of what happens inside the body on the physiological level. We also have various levels of feelings. And, we have thoughts.

It is possible to expand the range of perception through changes in diet, exercises, sleep, environment, relations, focus etc. It is even possible to develop senses additional to the existing 7. Why 7? Because in addition to the five physical senses: touch, taste, smell, hearing and vision - it is also possible to develop the feelings to such an extent as to feel other people at a distance and transmit them a desired feeling either low, such as fear, or sublime, such as love and happiness. This gives us 6. The 7th sense is the brain that can be developed to perceive and transmit thoughts. Actually, this 7th sense is not only about thoughts. This is a big, separate and irrelevant topic.

But whatever we perceive through the expanded senses will still be external to us. Therefore I do not call this spiritual.

Another big change that we can undergo is our interaction with the reality. At some level the reality clearly interacts with us. Things around stop to be random but a clear result of our past and current actions, feelings and thoughts or clear signs of what's coming next. This is the first step in the direction of the spiritual because it is a core belief in Judaism that the closer we are to God the closer He is to us.

But the true spiritual begins when you step out of everything that is perceived and exist as your true self. This is a tricky phrase but I hope to be able to explain this later.

### Difference between spiritual experience and the true spirituality

The process of expanding the perception and the abilities is intriguing and pleasant. People usually do this out of curiocity and because the process brings numerous benefits starting with health and ending in the feeling of bliss, in expanded perception and abilities. In other words, the whole process is either a natural growth, like a tree rising up to the sun or the whole process is done for personal benefit. The benefit is not necessarily malicious. It can be done for good goals such as being near God or for attaining a liberation.

But even if the process is done for a spiritual goal, it is done for a personal benefit.

This is the difference between technical spiritual achivements and the 'true spirituality'. Two people can have the same level of spiritual abilities but one attained them through spiritual practices whereas the other one attained these abilities while living a Divine life for the benefit of others.

### Why we need it

So, if living a Divine life is preferable to searching the spiritual, why am I writing about it?
Because after we are born our awarensss gradually shifts into the physical whereas the Divine soul strives to be free and express itself. 
The soul craves infinity, freedom, creativity, power, love. These innate inclinations can be expressed in the physical world. Desire for infinity can be expressed as a desire to travel, to ammass possessions, friends, knowledge. The desire for freedom can be expressed as a desire of safety and non-atachment. The desire of love can be expressed as a chase for pleasures. But the same basic desires of the soul can lead a person to the search for the Divine experiences.

Therefore these innate desires of the soul cannot be blocked. It is natural for the soul to liberate itself. But during this process the soul is presented with 3 choices: to give in to the physical needs and desires, to liberate itself, to serve God and help others.

A soul that loses control and awareness into the physical, is a soul who has slept through its life. It either needs troubles to see the transient nature of the world or it will suffer after leaving the body and looking back at the life. 

A soul that has reached God through spiritual growth, still needs to care for others to be a fully Divine.

A soul that has spent its life caring for others can be of 3 types:
- a soul without self awareness. A person's awareness of oneself may be in the intellect or in the feelings and decisions are made on there. Even if the awareness of such a person will not shift deeper by the end of life, after leaving the body the soul will see that its lived a truly Divine life.
- a soul without self awareness but with information about a soul's duty to care.
- a soul with self awareness.

### Is it necessary

Is it necessary to search for the spiritual? It is the nature of the soul. It cannot no be blocked. But it is more important to care for others.

### How to experience the spiritual

It is not necessary to experience the spiritual. It is the nature of the soul to express itself. It will find a way out. When a child is born, the parents gradually teach the child how to survive and prosper in the physical world. The awareness shifts into the physical. As this happens, the soul starts to seek a way out. It is like a child without a guidance. Being aware only of the physical tools, it chooses what corresponds to its divine nature. For example, it may choose to explore the world as an expression of its infinite nature. Exploring the world is a long way to deepening self awareness and caring for others. If a soul does not have a person who guides it, it may use information that will guide it to its goal. The best guidance is by the One who created the soul and the world. Therefore it is essential for a soul to study and follow the Torah. 

Studying the Torah is a long process too. But any process of growth is gradual. God did not give us something that is beyond our ability. The Torah is written so that every soul will find a good starting point for itself. Some souls will be fascinated by the production of the parchment for a Torah scroll. Another soul may seek the transcendental hidden among the letters of the Torah. Etc. Therefore the study of the Torah does lead into Infinity. 

Broadening the mind through the study unavoidably leads to better choices.

In addition to studying the Torah, it is also important to live by it. Because a soul must use the body as the tool and not just follow its needs and desires. A soul should learn to use the body as the tool for caring for others.

#### Types of commandments

There are various ways to classify the commandments. One way is by the target of caring.

**Oneself**. In order to be able to care for others, a soul must learn to care for itself and its body. One example of such a commandment is kosher food. Kosher food restructures the body to be a transmitter of the Divine light. This also introduces balance which is a core principle.

**Parents**. One example is the commandment to respect the parents.

**Spouse, friends, neighbors, colleagues**. Examples: providing the wife, caring for widows and orphans, loving fellows, caring for the poor, respecting the property, paying on time, non-stealing and many many more.

**Children**. Example: teaching the Torah.

**Animals**. Examples: letting them rest on shabbat, not causing suffering.

**Nature**. Example: prohibition to distroy anything without need.

**God**. Examples: behaving respectfully towards God, His Torah, Holy objects and places, Torah scollars etc.; being explicitly grateful through blessings etc.; And many others.

Some commandments are hard to understand. Either their mechanism or their goal are not clear. For example, tefillin. This simply means one thing: you do not understand them at the current stage of your life. It is possible to understand them through gradually changing yourself. In order to change yourself you should do them. You will never understand them if you don't do them. Chicken and egg. You can find various explanations for such commandments but they will always be external to your experience. You can know everything about an apple but never taste it. Before you start to understand a commandment, use it for establishing a close relationship with God by doing it for Him.

#### Through commandments

Most commandments have a physical element. This way a soul can use the body for behaving Divinely in the physical world. 

The mere fact that a soul uses the body instead of following the body's desires increases the soul's self expression in the physical.

But this way of performing the commandmenmts is incomplete because between the soul and the body there are 2 additional components: mind and feelings. The full chain is: soul -> mind -> feelings -> body. All 4 must participate in performing a physical commandment. For example, when saying a blessing, it should be performed with the feeling of gratitude (feeling) and full concentration and intention and direction towards God.

Regarding the feelings, a good baseline are the feelings of submission and gratitude.

Regarding the mind, a good baseline are concentration and awareness of the presence of God.

In order to involve the mind, feelings and body in a commandmet, a commandment should be performed as a sequence: 
- first realize that you are in the presence of God
- then intend to perform the commandment
- then feel gratitude. These are your feelings. You can create them. It is just a matter of practice.
- then do the commandment

#### Through behavior, attitude, feelings, words, point of view, meditation

But not all commandments have the physical aspect. The first Jewish author who focused on these commandments was [Bahya Ibn Pakuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ibn_Paquda) (1050–1120) in his bool [Duties of the Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Duties-Classics-Library-English-Hebrew/dp/0873067657). He went over all earlier writings starting with the Torah and wrote about commandments perfored through the behavior, attitude, feelings, mind at all time even when not performing a specific physical commandment.
