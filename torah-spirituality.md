# Jewish Spirituality

This is a work in progress. So far I am just throwing here random ideas.

This text is written for people interested in direct spiritual experience. The main reason for writing this is that increasingly more people are interested in the spiritual but most practical material is based on 'eastern' practices whereas the Jewish people have been transmitting and developing spirituality for 4000 years since Abraham. 

The Jewish spiritual practice is not easily available because if you're a Jewish 'guru' (rebbe, for example), first of all transmit it to people around you. If you feel that your experience and knowledge are broadly useful, you publish a book in Hebrew. Why Hebrew? Because languages come and go but Hebrew stays. Therefore to find a Jewish spiritual master requires a true desire and a consistent effort whereas finding a YouTube video about meditation is a just few seconds away. 

An opposite issue is that there is increasingly more material about the Jewish spirituality in English but it's either not intended as a practical guide or it is shallow.

Therefore I have decided to share a few highlights and a few references to books. The main emphasis is on constant focused parctice, not on belief, not on understanding, not on knowledge. The study of Torah, which is included in the list, starts with sitting, reading and trying to understand but these are just tools. 

The text is based on my personal experience as of now. My only hope is to keep improving.

First I have to explain the source of Jewish spirituality, which is a formal part, and then I'll dive into the spirituality. If you get board dive in [here](https://github.com/danielnuriyev/spirituality/blob/main/torah-spirituality.md#jewish-point-of-view)

## Sources

Sources of Jewish knowledge:
- spiritual practice started by Avraham (Abraham) and Sarah and transmitted through their grandson Yaaqov's (Jacob) descendants down to us.
- texts received from the Creator of this world by prophets starting with Moshe (Moses)
- meanings of the texts transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- religious and spiritual practice transmitted through generations from Moshe down to us
- attitudes transmitted through generations of parents from Avraham and Sarah down to us. AKA culture.

In Hebrew the Jewish religion is called התורה The Torah which literally means the direction, instruction, teaching.

### Creator

When I write the 'Creator', the natural question is how do we know that there is the Creator.

There is a list of standard answers such as prophecies, tradition, logical deduction etc.

But the real answer lies in our innermost core which is Divine. This core is the soul, or נשמה in Hebrew.

Regarding the soul there are several types of people:
- a person whose awareness is on the level of the soul.
- a person whose awareness is in the resonable thinking. Reasonable thinking makes perfect sense as long as it allows the expansion of awareness.
- a person who lives through feelings. Although some feelings such the infinity and unity can lead this person to discover the soul, such a person is affected by everything and cannot live as a soul steadily.
- a person whose awareness is in the social and physical. Such a person may believe in something Divine because under the layers of the physical and social needs there still lies a Divine soul that tries to express itself.

In all types of people the soul is striving to live and express itself because it is its nature.

One fruit picked along a spiritual path is shifting the awareness into the soul.

### Transmission

How do we know that the Torah has been transmitted faithfully. Because children grow practicing it and studying it all their lives. There has been no other religion in which all men all life long have been studying their religion.

But the surrounding civilizations do affect the application of the Jewish principles and laws. For example, in the past we read a Torah scroll by the candle light, now we read the same scroll under the electic light.

## Jewish Point of View

The best explanation of who we are, what this world is, its goal, what we should do etc. is given by Moshe Chaim Luzzato in [The Way of God best translated by Aryeh Kaplan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087306769X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_thcv_p1_i7).

Everything that we perceive is a tool for living as a soul. The tools are possessions and body.
Living as a soul means:
- using the tools for the benefit of others. Benefit may be physical such as providing a place to live and healthy food. It may be non physical such as being an example of a Divine life. _Others_ includes not only people.
- being grateful for everything, treating problems as lessons, living with the awareness that God is here
- minimizing the physical needs
- unveiling the soul by calming the mind. I will explain this below. And by not limiting ourselves as long as the dreams are creative and benefitial.

## Core difference between the Torah and most other religions and spiritual systems

An important distinction of the Torah from most other religions and spiritual systems is that the goal of the Torah is not the spiritual development but spiritual living. In most other religions and systems the goal is the personal spiritual benefit such as the feeling of infinity of love of merging into God, of nearness to God, of liberation and enlightment. In Judaism we do not seek the personal spiritual benefit. We seek to benefit other souls out of love for them and for God, we seek to serve God out of love for God.

Why? Because at the core we are already Divine, infinite, free, blissful etc. God made us this way. We can only be grateful and loving.

The spiritual benefits that the other religions focus on are by-products of living as a soul.

The goals of these other religions and spiritual systems contain a pitfall because to unite with God, to be with God etc. one must be as God who is not an egoist. [The Way of God](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087306769X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_thcv_p1_i7) and other books explain that God is perfect and does not need anything, therefore God did not create the world for himself. 

### The purpose of creation

God created us - the Divine beings. God created this world that veils the Divine. God planted us in this world and at every instant we have the choice between the worldly and the Divine actions. Through these choices we gradually deserve our Divinity. A person who inherits the greatest wealth is never the same as a person who achieves the greatest wealth through creative and benefitial work.

But why did God create us? Creation of Devine beings is the act of ultimate good.
