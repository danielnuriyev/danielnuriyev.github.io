# Jewish Spiritual Method

Jewish spiritual method as I see it through practice and study.

## What is _spiritual_

First I would like to define the term _spiritual_ as it will be used in this text.

Different people understand this word differently. Some common understandings:
- following rituals
- moral behavior
- kind behavior
- being into arts, literature, philosophy, religion
- beliefs in sub/supernatural reality and parapsychology
- magical powers
- altered states of consciousness

Judaism has some of it:
- rituals: physical observance of commandments and traditions
- attitudes: how a person should view the world
- behaviors: how a person should behave
- feelings: how a person should feel towards God, parents, friends, the poor etc. and how a person should feel others
- Judaism has a long history of religious, spiritual and mystical
- Judaism has a long history of people who performed miracles

But in this text the word _spiritual_ will refer to what is beyond what we currently perceive.

Let us look at how we perceive the world. 
- We have the 5 external senses. 
- We also perceive what happens inside our body 
  - on the physical level
  - on the level of feelings
  - in the mind

We can expand the perception.
- We can expand the range of the 5 external senses through nutrition, relaxation, focus, exercises.
- We can develop the ability to feel not only our feelings but also to clearly feel the feelings of others (6th sense!) (and to project feelings)
- We can calm our mind. Mind is a space where ideas appear. They are viewed. And some are selected for further observation, processing or action. But who observes the ideas? This Observer is the soul. **Spiritual pertains to the soul**.

Thus, in this text _spiritual_ refers to 
- discovering the soul
- shifting the awareness to the soul
- to living as a soul
- to soul's expression in this world
- to organs of perception and perceptions that awake when the awareness goes up to the soul

## Spiritual Discovery

Spiritual discovery is the process during which the spiritual researcher shifts the focus 
- away from the external world
- away from the body
- away from the feelings
- away from thoughts
When the focus is withdrawn, a new level of reality gradually becomes evident.
This is what people call _spiritual growth_, _spiritual development_.

### Why some people are attracted to the spiritual discovery

Because the core of every human being is the soul that seeks any opportunity to express itself through the layers of thoughts, feelings, social and physical desires. And it's not easy because the awareness is constantly attracted by anything. That's why even when a person has random thoughts that there is something beyond the usual perceptions, most people fall back asleep.

But since you are here, read about the steps to become self aware.

### General spiritual discovery

The main principle is to wipe layers of the unnecessary off your shining soul.

**declutter time**

The goal is to spend time doing fewer and more important things.

**declutter space**

The goal is to be in a place that has minimum objects, ordered, clean, aired, quiet to reduce distractions.

**declutter ecomonic life**
- Buy only what is absolutely necessary. Invest the rest. Donate and throw anything you don't need.
- Continuously improve your efficiency, social, organizational skills. Continuously work for the next level of money making. Anything else equals intentional waste of time. Keep in mind that wiping layers that conceal your soul is opposite of becoming a passive blob.
- Donate. Especially to people who need money for a good cause but cannot earn it at the moment. *Spiritual discovery* is only half of the Way. The other half is sharing. You will not make it all the way up, without changing yourself into a sharing and caring person on each level.

**declutter social life**

Minimize the number of social interactions to people who care about you and who you should care about.

**clean the body**

Eat valuable nutrients in amounts that don't make you sleepy. Organic, free range, vegetarian are great pluses.

**structure the body**

Exercises that cause you to breathe, like fast walking, and stretching exercises make the body clean and well structured which gives us energy, good emotions and clarity of mind.

**calm down the feelings**
- Be calm no matter what. It is not the same as emotionless, on the contrary, it leads to steady happiness independent of circumstances.
- Be forgiving, respectful, patient, grateful, kind, caring. I can rationalilze each of these features in the context of wiping layers hiding the soul but caring is based on a reason is not true caring. Just care. Caring must be proactive.

**behavior**
- Be honest and trustworthy. This requires character and bravery. Both mean freedom.
- When you have to or you choose to act, an action should be beneficial, respectful, patient, grateful, kind, caring to you and the world.

**mindset**
- Detach what you perceive from your understanding of what you perceive. Perceive without explaining to yourself.
- Get rid of all limiting believes. When you think that something is impossible, simply replace this thought with the opposite. These are your thoughts, after all. Do not think about how 'it' can be possible because this way you limit yourself in a different way.
- Know that your current thoughts create your future.

**calm down the mind**
- Minimize the info input to what you really need. 
- Focus fully on anything that you do. 
- Pull yourself out of thinking that is not directly related to what you are doing now.
- Sleep

**meditate**

Start with observing the thoughts from aside without diving into them because in the depth of your current mind, thoughts is the deepest layer that you are familiar with. As the thoughts wade away, you will face several phenomena:
- the mind will become clearer and faster. Your body will become lighter and happier. Dormant abilities will gradually wake up. I will not list them. Enjoy the discovery. It is crucial for the new state not to occupy your attention.
- the one who is observing the thoughts - you, who you really are at the core, the soul - will become increasingly proactive... This level of consciousness is new to most people and I can explain it only by analogy which is similar to descibing the taste of an apple. Therefore, just go for it. It leads to yourself and to a next level of reality, a next level of decision making and living.

Also:
- if by now you have been an atheist or an agnostic, and you keep going deeper into meditation, the new reality that your will start facing and your new self, will not match your previous views. At the same time, the broader reality that you will face will not contradict logic, reason, science, it will simply provide more information to your logic and reason. Science is about describing the reality, after all.
- if by now you have had some metaphysical beliefs, the new reality may not necessarily match them. Or you will see the deeper roots of your beliefs.
- you will see all people as souls at different levels of awareness. The human behavior will become obvious to you. You will become more compassionate, patient, less judgemental, more helpful.

The biggest change in your view of reality, though, will come from the realization of Something Divine. I have alluded to this when I mentioned an atheist, an agnostic and a believer. They are essentially no different. They are just people with a yes/no thought on an abstract subject. Whereas direct experience of the Divine places YOU in the center of Infinity surrounded by the Wisdom and Care and causes you to experience Humility, Gratitude, Love, Selflessness, Truth. 

Important: do not skip any of the steps. If you go directly into meditation and succeed without having reduced your activity, desires, feelings, attitudes, thoughts to the creative, beneficial, positive, healthy, successful minimum, those parts of your life that are not fixed, may become disproportionately disbalanced.

**spread**

The next step is to share your new world with others. This step is natural. It happens even if you don't do anything. Your vibe simply changes the reality around.
But this also brings me to the discussion of the commandments in the Torah.

### Torah commandments for spiritual discovery

Similar to the steps of the spiritual discovery, Torah commandments affect all layers of life: 
- time: time cycles and specific times are prescribed (circumcision, bar/bat mitswa; day, week, month year, 7 years of shemita etc.)
- place: mezuza, appropriate places for prayer and study, the Holy Temple etc.
- economic life: how to work honestly, how to pay employees on time, how to support the poor etc.
- social life: how to respect parents, care for the wife, educate the children, treat teachers, treat people, treat enemies etc.
- clothing: what clothing is considered appropriate for spiritual life
- food and body: netilat yadayim, position for the prayer, appropriate food and treatment of animals and nature etc.
- feelings, attitude: blessings and prayers, what feelings should be a part of observing a commandment, what feelings must be experienced at all times.
- intellect: the commandment to study and teach the Torah
- mind: what thoughts to keep out, focus during the commandments, intentions of commandments ect. Plus, hitbonenut - meditation.
- transcendental: how to establish direct, correct and positive relationship with God

Therefore, is it possible to lay out the commandments as the steps of the spiritual growth? It won't hurt but the **goal of the commandments is opposite: it is not for the soul to gradually return to itself, find itself, become aware of itself and then blissfully abide in itself. Commandments are the next step: how a soul must use its mind, feelings, body, possessions, time in an ideal way.**

Is *spiritual discovery* excluded from the Torah? Most people start the process of spiritual discovery unconsciously. It starts with people taking better care of their health, relations, finances etc. Recently increasingly more people are interested in psychology and meditation. But still the percent of people who go all the way is close to zero. Most souls never fully find themselves and never fully function in this world. The commandments are a shortcut. A soul can start functioning as it was designed whether it is aware of itself or not. It is similar to driving a car. A person can learn how to drive and start driving by following the guidelines of the manufacturer and the laws. If the driver has the interest to learn more about the car, why not. But driving is different from the commandments in one aspect: **every time a soul uses a tool, it flows into the tool giving it more of its consciousness, life, energy, light. Therefore, if the soul uses the mind correctly, the mind becomes more vivid and enlightened, when it uses the heart correctly, the heart shines etc.**

**To sum up**
- Everything that we perceive is a tool that a soul can use. Tools are the mind, the feelings, the body, the world around. Commandments mandate the perfect way a soul can use a tool. 'Mandate' because a soul must be proactive in the world.
- When a soul uses a tool, the soul flows into the tool. The tool itself becomes a channel for the soul. The tool comes closer to its ideal structure and function by becoming more pure and energized.
- The location of the awareness is also a tool. In some cases you have to focus on a physical commandment. In other cases you are free to keep the awareness in the soul or higher/deeper (God!)
- In addition, when you follow Torah's world view, 
  - you live inside the Divine who is Initinite and everywhere. You are constantly surrounded by Wizdom and Care. You are in constant interaction with the Inifinite.
  - You perceive others as souls at various levels of awareness. And naturally you start treating others with Compassion and with Care, like God Himself.

This is what it feels when you observe the commandments as designed. Although we Jews observe the commandments simply because God told us to, like loving kids. Deeper experiences are natural but are neither the reason nor our goal. On the contrary, aiming for experiences makes a practice not sincere and dependent, not free.

#### Why is it difficult to observe the commandments ?

Because now we want to have the full information in advance whereas on any real spiritual path information that a more experienced practicioner gives you is out of your scope and the only way to experience the same is to trust that practicioner and practice. This is no different from science but science does not require you to change. Science requires you to observe or use devices and then generalize observations into principles and rules. In a spiritual discovery you must rebuild yourselft and direct your focus inside.

Another reason is that any change causes resistance. Even if you try to change for the worse. Especially given the fact that observing the commandments is not only easy but it feels good. Take a regular day. You start it by preparing to speak to the Infinite, the Ultimate, the Best Reality. Then you spend your day being dressed modestly, being nice to people, eating kosher food, which is not a big effort, and you thank God for the food. Objectively, if this is difficult. The difficulty is purely psychological.

That is why accepting the Torah and the prescribed way of performing its commandments is based purely on habbit, trusting the parents, beliefs that make more sense versus some other beliefs etc.

The core reason why a person observes the commandments is the soul's innate connection with the Divine but then why some people don't observe the commandments? There are multiple reasons into which I will not go.

##### What to do?!

- if you observe the commandments, 
  - do them as an interaction / ralationship / contact with God. Add proper attitude and heart. Your vide will spread.
  - openly talk to people from your point of view without excuses but without sounding condescending, preaching or cuckoo. When you live in the Divine reality, it affects people
- if you do not observe the commandments but anything in the text has touched you:
  - you can start the process of the *spiritual discovery* but it requires constant effort way greater than hanging on a smartphone.
  - you can skip to the end and start observing the commandments. It also requires effort because you have to learn the technical aspects without knowing their spiritual mechanism and the precise effects. But if you do it as a relationship with the Inifinite you will gradually see the world change around you. Some changes are temporarily painful because you are switching to a different track.
  - you can start with changing your world view by realizing that you are surrounded by the Inifinite Divine but here lies the danger of forever staying a blissful lazy philosophising klumnik (good-for-nothing).
  
#### Torah commandments and non-Jews

This text is for my fellow Jews. But since it is public and in English, and everyone can read it...

If you are a non-Jew and after reading this text have become interested in observing and studying the Jewish commandments and the Torah then
- you do not have to become Jewish because according to the Jewish tradition God gave Noah and through him to all the mankind the 7 Laws of Noah according to which you have to accept the one God as prescibed by God (no Trinity etc.), get rid of any intermediaries (sub-gods, angels, forces, spirits, souls etc.) and their depictions, be honest, just, compassionate etc. More [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah). And in addition to these basic laws you can practice the *spiritual discovery*, live a *spiritual life* (the phase after the discovery) and also study the practice the Jewish spiritual worldiew.
- you are always welcome to convert.

Think, try, read to expand your world view. One book describes Judaism and its world view on a general level: [The Way of God and the Essay of Fundamentals by Moshe Chaim Luzzato translated by Rav Aryeh Kaplan](https://www.amazon.com/Way-God-Derech-Hashem/dp/1598264672/).

Another useful book by Moshe Chaim Luzzato is [Path of the Just](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Torah-Classics-Library-Pocket/dp/) in which he describes the steps that one should take to rise from our current level to the level of Holiness.
