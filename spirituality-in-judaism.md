# Jewish Spirituality

Jewish spirituality as I see it through practice and study.

This is a work in progress.

## What is _spiritual_

First I would like to define the term _spiritual_ as it will be used in this text.

Different people understand this word differently. Some common understandings:
- following rituals
- moral behavior
- kind behavior
- being into arts, literature, philosophy, religion
- beliefs in sub/supernatural reality and parapsychology
- magical powers
- altered states of consciousness

Judaism has some of it:
- rituals: physical observance of commandments and traditions
- attitudes: how a person should view the world
- behaviors: how a person should behave
- feelings: how a person should feel towards God, parents, friends, the poor etc. and how a person should feel others.
- words: how to speak with God and people and how a person should listen.
- Judaism has a long history of litarature ranging from down to earth topics such as geography 
up to the most abstract ideas about the origin of the world and the human mind.
- Judaism has a long history of people who performed miracles.

But in this text the word _spiritual_ will refer to what is beyond what we currently perceive.

Let us look at how we perceive the world. 
- We have the 5 external senses. 
- We also perceive what happens inside our body 
  - on the physical level
  - on the level of feelings
  - in the mind

We can expand the perception.
- We can expand the range of the 5 external senses through nutrition, relaxation, focus, exercises.
- We can develop the ability to feel not only our feelings but also to clearly feel the feelings of others (6th sense!) (and to project feelings)
- We can calm our mind. Mind is a space where ideas appear. They are viewed. And some are selected for further observation, processing or action. But who observes the ideas? This Observer is the soul. **Spiritual pertains to the soul**.

Thus, in this text _spiritual_ refers to 
- discovering the soul
- shifting the awareness to the soul
- to living as a soul
- to soul's expression in this world
- to organs of perception and perceptions that awake when the awareness goes up to the soul

## Spiritual Discovery

Spiritual discovery is the process during which the spiritual researcher shifts the focus 
- away from the external world
- away from the body
- away from the feelings
- away from thoughts
When the focus is withdrawn, a new level of reality gradually becomes evident.
This is what people call _spiritual growth_, _spiritual development_.

### Why some people are attracted to the spiritual discovery

Because the core of every human being is the soul that seeks any opportunity to express itself through the layers of thoughts, feelings, social and physical desires. And it's not easy because the awareness is constantly attracted by anything. That's why even when a person has random thoughts that there is something beyond the usual perceptions, most people fall back asleep.

But since you are here, read about the steps to become self aware.

### General spiritual discovery

The main principle is to wipe layers of the unnecessary off your shining soul.

**declutter time**
The goal is to spend time doing fewer and more important things.

**declutter space**
The goal is to be in a place that has minimum objects, ordered, clean, aired, quiet.

**declutter ecomonic life**
- Buy only what is absolutely necessary. Invest the rest. Donate and throw anything you don't need.
- Continuously improve your efficiency, social, organizational skills. Continuously work for the next level of money making. Anything else equals intentional waste of time. Keep in mind that wiping layers that conceal your soul is oppositeof becoming a passive blob.

**declutter social life**
Minimize the number of social interactions to people who care about you and who you should care about.

**clean the body**
Eat valuable nutrients in amounts that don't make you sleepy. Organic, free range, vegetarian are great pluses.

**structure the body**
This is a bit opposite to decluttering because this requires proactive exercise of 2 types: exercises that cause you to breathe, like fast walking, and stretching. Stamina exercises clean the body, stretching puts bones in place. This is important for healthy circulation.

**calm down the feelings**
- Be calm no matter what. It is not the same as emotionless, on the contrary, it leads to steady happiness.
- Be forgiving, respectful, patient, grateful, kind, caring. I can rationalilze each of these features in the context of wiping layers hiding the soul but if caring is based on a reason is not true caring. Just care. Why is it necessary. Because as I will explain later, spiritual discovery is only half of the way. If you do not change your feelings, you will not be able to go much deeper.

**attitude**
- Detach what you perceive from your understanding of what you perceive. Perceive without explaining to yourself.
- Get rid of all limiting believes. When you think that something is impossible, simply replace this thought with the opposite. These are your thoughts, after all. Do not think about how 'it' can be possible because this way you limit yourself in a different way.
- Be honest and trustworthy. This requires character and bravery. Both mean freedom.
- When you have to or you choose to act, an action should be beneficial, respectful, patient, grateful, kind, caring to you and the world.

**calm down the mind**
- Minimize the info input to what you really need. 
- Focus fully on anything that you do. 
- Pull yourself out of thinking that is not directly related to what you are doing now.
- Sleep

**meditate**
Start with observing the thoughts from aside without diving into them because in the depth of your current mind, thoughts is the deepest layer that you are familiar with. As the thoughts wade away, you will face 2 opposite phenomena:
- the mind will become more energized because its energy is not spent on thinking, your existing mental abilities will become faster, clearer etc. You will also discover new mental abilities that were dormant, but they are still a part of the existing mind. The trick here is not to dive into them.
- the one who is observing the thoughts - you, who you really are at the core, the soul - will become increasingly proactive... This level of consciousness is too new to most people that I can explain it only by the analogy which is like descibing the taste of an apple. Therefore, just go for it. It leads to yourself and to a next level of reality, a next level of decision making and living.

Also:
- if by now you have been an atheist or an agnostic, and you keep going deeper and deeper into meditation, the new reality that your will start facing and your new self, will not match your previous views. At the same time, the broader reality that you will face will not contradict logic, reason, science, it will just provide more information to your logic and reason. Science is about describing the reality, after all.
- if by now you have had some metaphysical beliefs, the new reality may not necessarily match them. Or you will see the deeper roots of your beliefs.
- you will see all people as souls at different levels of awareness. The human behavior will become obvious to you. You will become more compassionate, patient, less judgemental, more helpful.

The biggest change in your view of reality, though, will come from the realization of God. I have alluded to this when I mentioned an atheist, an agnostic and a believer. They are essentially no different. They were just people with a yes/no thought on an abstract subject. Whereas direct experience of the Divine places YOU in the center of Infinity surrounded by the Inifinite Wisdom and Care and causes you to experience Inifinite Humility, Gratitude, Love, Self Sacrifice. 

Important: 
- do not skip any of the steps. If you go directly into meditation and succeed without having reduced your activity, desires, feelings, attitudes, thoughts to the creative, beneficial, positive, healthy, successful minimum, those parts of your life that are not fixed, may become disproportionately disbalanced.
- This is only the spiritual discovery. It is a way up or deep. It is only half of the way. I will write about the other half later in this text.

### Torah commandments for spiritual discovery

Similar to the steps of the spiritual discovery, Torah commandments encompass all layers of life: 
- time management: personal and global time cycles are prescribed (circumcision, bar/bat mitswa; day, week, month year, 7 years of shemita etc.)
- place management: mezuza, appropriate places for prayer and study, the Holy Temple etc.
- economic life: how to work honestly, how to pay employees on time, how to support the poor etc.
- social life: how to respect parents, care for the wife, educate the children, treat teachers, treat people, treat enemies etc.
- clothing: what clothing is considered appropriate for spiritual life
- food and body: netilat yadayim, position for the prayer, appropriate food and treatment of animals and nature etc.
- feelings, attitude: blessings and prayers, what feelings should be a part of observing a commandment, what feelings must be experience at all times.
- intellect: the commandment to study and teach the Torah
- mind: what thoughts to keep out, focus during the commandments, intentions of commandments ect. Plus, hitbonenut - meditation.
- transcendental: talk only to God, no idols etc.

Therefore, is it possible to lay out the commandments as the steps of the spiritual growth? It won't hurt but the **goal of the commandments is opposite: it is not for the soul to gradually return to itself, find itself, become aware of itself and then blissfully abide in itself. Commandments are the next step: how a soul must use its mind, feelings, body, possessions, time in an ideal way.**

Is *spiritual discovery* excluded from the Torah? Most people start the process of spiritual discovery unconsciously. It starts with people taking better care of their health, relations, finances etc. Recently increasingly more people become interested in psychology and meditation. But still the percent of people who go all the way is close to zero. Most souls never never fully find themselves and never fully function in this world. The commandments are a shortcut. A soul can start functioning as it was designed to whether it is aware of itself or not. It is similar to driving a car. A person can learn how to drive and start driving by  following the guidelines of the manufacturer and the laws. If the driver has the interest to learn more about the car, why not. But driving is different from the commandments in one aspect: **every time a soul uses a tool, it flows into the tool giving it more of its consciousness, life, energy, light. Therefore, if the soul uses the mind correctly, the mind becomes more vivid and enlightened, when it uses the heart correctly, the heart shines etc.**

**To sum up**
- Everything that we perceive is a tool that a soul can use. Tools are the mind, the feelings, the body, the world around. Commandments mandate the perfect way a soul can use a tool. 'Mandate' because a soul must be proactive in the world.
- When a soul uses a tool, the soul flows into the tool. The tool itself becomes a channel for the soul. The tool comes closer to its ideal structure and function by becoming more pure and energized.
- The location of the awareness is also a tool. In some cases you have to focus on the physical commandment. In other cases you are free to keep the awareness in the soul or higher/deeper (God!)
