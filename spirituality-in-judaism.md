# Jewish Spirituality

Jewish spirituality as I see it through practice and study.

This is a work in progress.

## What is _spiritual_

First I would like to define the term _spiritual_ as it will be used in this text.

Different people understand this word differently. Some common understandings:
- following rituals
- moral behavior
- kind behavior
- being into arts, literature, philosophy, religion
- beliefs in sub/supernatural reality and parapsychology
- magical powers
- altered states of consciousness

Judaism has some of it:
- rituals: physical observance of commandments and traditions
- attitudes: how a person should view the world
- behaviors: how a person should behave
- feelings: how a person should feel towards God, parents, friends, the poor etc. and how a person should feel others.
- words: how to speak with God and people and how a person should listen.
- Judaism has a long history of litarature ranging from down to earth topics such as geography 
up to the most abstract ideas about the origin of the world and the human mind.
- Judaism has a long history of people who performed miracles.

But in this text the word _spiritual_ will refer to what is beyond what we currently perceive.

Let us look at how we perceive the world. 
- We have the 5 external senses. 
- We also perceive what happens inside our body 
  - on the physical level
  - on the level of feelings
  - in the mind

We can expand the perception.
- We can expand the range of the 5 external senses through nutrition, relaxation, focus, exercises.
- We can develop the ability to feel not only our feelings but also to clearly feel the feelings of others (6th sense!) (and to project feelings)
- We can calm our mind. Mind is a space where ideas appear. They are viewed. And some are selected for further observation, processing or action. But who observes the ideas? This Observer is the soul. **Spiritual pertains to the soul**.

Thus, in this text _spiritual_ refers to 
- discovering the soul
- shifting the awareness to the soul
- to living as a soul
- to soul's expression in this world
- to organs of perception and perceptions that awake when the awareness goes up to the soul
