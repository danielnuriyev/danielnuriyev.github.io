# Jewish Spirituality

Jewish spirituality as I see it through practice and study.

This is a work in progress.

## What is _spiritual_

First I would like to define the term _spiritual_ as it will be used in this text.

Different people understand this word differently. Some common understandings:
- following rituals
- moral behavior
- kind behavior
- being into arts, literature, philosophy, religion
- beliefs in sub/supernatural reality and parapsychology
- magical powers
- altered states of consciousness

Judaism has some of it:
- rituals: physical observance of commandments and traditions
- attitudes: how a person should view the world
- behaviors: how a person should behave
- feelings: how a person should feel towards God, parents, friends, the poor etc. and how a person should feel others.
- words: how to speak with God and people and how a person should listen.
- Judaism has a long history of litarature ranging from down to earth topics such as geography 
up to the most abstract ideas about the origin of the world and the human mind.
- Judaism has a long history of people who performed miracles.

But in this text the word _spiritual_ will refer to what is beyond what we currently perceive.

Let us look at how we perceive the world. 
- We have the 5 external senses. 
- We also perceive what happens inside our body 
  - on the physical level
  - on the level of feelings
  - in the mind

We can expand the perception.
- We can expand the range of the 5 external senses through nutrition, relaxation, focus, exercises.
- We can develop the ability to feel not only our feelings but also to clearly feel the feelings of others (6th sense!) (and to project feelings)
- We can calm our mind. Mind is a space where ideas appear. They are viewed. And some are selected for further observation, processing or action. But who observes the ideas? This Observer is the soul. **Spiritual pertains to the soul**.

Thus, in this text _spiritual_ refers to 
- discovering the soul
- shifting the awareness to the soul
- to living as a soul
- to soul's expression in this world
- to organs of perception and perceptions that awake when the awareness goes up to the soul

## Spiritual Discovery

Spiritual discovery is the process during which the spiritual researcher shifts the focus 
- away from the external world
- away from the body
- away from the feelings
- away from thoughts
When the focus is withdrawn, a new level of reality gradually becomes evident.
This is what people call _spiritual growth_, _spiritual development_.

### Why some people are attracted to the spiritual discovery

Because the core of every human being is the soul that seeks any opportunity to express itself through the layers of thoughts, feelings, social and physical desires. And it's not easy because the awareness is constantly attracted by anything. That's why even when a person has random thoughts that there is something beyond the usual perceptions, most people fall back asleep.

But since you are here, read about the steps to become selft aware.

### General spiritual discovery

The main principle is to peel off layers:

**declutter time**
The goal is to spend time doing fewer and more important things.
TO DO

**declutter space**
The goal is to be in a place that has minimum objects, ordered, clean, aired, quiet.

**declutter ecomonic life**
Buy only what is absolutely necessary. Invest the rest. Donate and throw anything you don't need.

**declutter social life**
Minimize the number of social interactions to people who care about you and who you should care about.

**clean the body**
Eat valuable nutrients in amounts that don't make you sleepy. Organic, free range, vegetarian are great pluses.

**energized body**
This is a bit opposite to decluttering because this requires proactive exercise of 2 types: exercises that cause you to breathe, like fast walking, and stretching. Stamina exercises clean the body as well, stretching puts bones in place. This is important for healthy circulation.

**calm down the feelings**
Be calm no matter what. It is not the same as emotionless, on the contrary, it leads to steady happiness.

**attitude**
TO DO

**calm down the mind**
Minimize the info input to what you really need. Focus fully on anything that you do. Rest.

**meditate**
Start with observing the thoughts from aside without diving into them because in the depth of your current mind, thoughts is the deepest layer that you are familiar with. As the thoughts wade away, you will face 2 opposite phenomena:
- the mind will become more energized because its energy is not spent on thinking, your existing mental abilities will become faster, clearer etc. You will also discover new mental abilities that were dormant, but they are still a part of the existing mind. The trick here is not to dive into them.
- the one who is observing the thoughts - you, who you really are at the core, the soul - will become increasingly proactive... This level of consciousness is to new to most people that I can explain it only by the analogy which is like descibing the taste of an apple. Therefore, just go for it. It leads to yourself and to a next level of reality, a next level of decision making and living.

Important: 
- do not skip any of the steps. If you go directly into meditation and succeed without having reduced your activity, desires, feelings, attitudes, thoughts to the creative, beneficial, positive, healthy, successful minimum, those parts of your life that are not fixed, may become disproportionately disbalanced.
- This is only the spiritual discovery. It is a way up or deep. It is only half of the way. I will write about the other half later in this text.
